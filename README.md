# Foundry cheatcodes

The purpose of this project is to implement smart contract examples for the Foundry [cheatcode](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/)). since the description of cheatcodes in the Foundry docs is very simple, especially for some complex cheatcodes, such as [etch](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/etch), the description is not very clear. Therefore, this project aims to demonstrate the usage of various cheatcodes through Foundry testing.

Proficient in foundry cheatcode can help smart contractors write various test cases and exploiting PoC
